    <h2><i>Snippet</i></h2>
    On her website, Lavigne states that she had learned a lot since her first record, Let Go: "I was involved in every aspect of making this record. I'm very hands-on. I knew how I wanted the drums, the guitar tones, and the structures to be. I understand the whole process so much better this time because I've been through it. I'm really picky with my sound." Regarding the album's theme, Lavigne stated, "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about....Like boys, like dating or relationships".

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <img src=Avril_Lavigne_2.jpg" alt="Avril Lavigne" width=50% title="Avril Lavigne"><br>
    <p><b><i>Avril Ramona Lavigne</i></b> was born on <i>September 27, 1984</i>, in <i>Belleville, Ontario, Canada,</i> and spent <mark>most</mark> of her childhood in <i>Napanee, Ontario</i>. For <b>more than a decade</b>, Avril Lavigne has enjoyed <mark>huge</mark> success with her <i>punk-influenced pop sound</i>. She has also branched out in new directions over the years, <b>including starting her own fashion line.</b></p>
   <p><b>Lavigne sang all the time as a child</b>, much to the chagrin of her two siblings. Raised by  <i>deeply</i> religious parents, she first started performing in church choirs. <b>Lavigne learned to play the guitar</b>, and began composing <i>her own</i> music as a teenager. At first, she reportedly focused on country music, eventually <b>changing her tune</b>. Leaving high school, she went first to <i>New York City</i> and then to <i>Los Angeles</i> to work with <b>Arista Records.</b></p><hr>
   <h2>Career</h2>
   <img src="Under_My_Skin.jpg" alt="Under My Skin" width=50% title="Under My Skin album cover">
   <p><i>In 2002, Lavigne released her first album</i>, <i>Let Go</i>. She scored a <mark>No. 1 hit</mark> with the single "Complicated," a <b>catchy tale of a difficult relationship</b>. More hits soon followed, such as "Sk8er Boi" and "I'm With You." In addition to her music, <i>Lavigne was deemed a style icon</i>; fans mimicked Lavigne's multicolored hair and copied her skate-punk fashions.</p>
    <i>Lavigne's music took a more contemplative turn with 2004's Under My Skin</i>, which did <u>not</u> fare as well as her first album. Still she had two modest hits, "Don't Tell Me" and "Nobody's Home," and <mark>one Top 10 track</mark>, "My Happy Ending." While <i>many of her songs explored relationship troubles and woes</i>, Lavigne's <b>personal</b> life seemed to be going well. <i>In 2006, she married fellow musician Deryck Whibley</i>, of Canadian pop-punk band <b>Sum 41.</b>

   <p><i>Returning to her more up-tempo and exuberant pop style</i>, Lavigne released <i>The Best Damn Thing</i> in 2007. She landed a Top 10 hit with the infectious "Girlfriend." A Rolling Stone critic called the song <mark>"hypercatchy"</mark> and said that the album had <b>"big doses of [Lavigne's] usual sass, anger and vulnerability."</b></p>
